# Motor Activity Detection with TinyML

This demonstrates how one can leverage Arduino Nano 33 BLE board to detect the activity of a motor using ML model trained using TensorFlow 2.0.
This project is inspired by magic_wand example of TensorFlow Lite for Microcontroller and  [Shahnawax/HAR-CNN-Keras](https://github.com/Shahnawax/HAR-CNN-Keras).
The CNN-based model is a mix-and-match between magic_wand CNN model and HAR-CNN-Keras model.
